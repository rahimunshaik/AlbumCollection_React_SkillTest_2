# Getting Started with Create React App- My Album Collection

This project is a web application that displays a collection of albums. Each album is represented by a title and an ID. The application allows users to add, update, and delete albums.

To create this react based web application we need some basic understanding about following things :--- I've updated README in a way relevant to my changes
Directory Structure to build Album Collection:
--public
    -index.html         //render data to browser
--src
    -components
        -AddAlbum.js    //logic of adding album in to list
        -AlbumsList.js  //rendering list data in it
        -App.js         //overall structure and logic of my application
        -ListData.js    //Albums arranged in list
        -Navbar.js      //navigation bar for my album
        -UpdateAlbum.js //Updating album data logic
    -index.js   //Entry point-rendering root
    -index.css  //applied styles for my Album

## Available Scripts
getting json data from:--https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How I want my app:
My App should look like album list 
where every album should contain main title ,update and delete button on it
when I click on update button It should redirect to form for the updation
When I click on delete the album should be deleted and display a message album deleted
when i click on add album it should contain a form with tile and Id 
and after submiting that form new album should get added into my list

this is how my App should have the list of albums in my app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
